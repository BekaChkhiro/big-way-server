Authentication Method
What do I need to use the payment API?
To use the payment API, HTTP Basic Auth is required. You will need to know the unique credentials4 of your business to enter the system. These credentials consist of two parameters, client_id, and client_secret, used as the username and password for business authentication.

How to obtain the credentials for entering the business system?
Upon registering a company as a business in the banking system and providing all the necessary data, the system provides the credentials client_id and client_secret necessary to enter the system. These credentials are unique identifiers of the business. It is impermissible to disclose or transfer the client_secret parameter to another person. Doing so significantly increases the probability of a security breach. The business cannot change the client_secret parameter.

Method description
This method allows businesses to undergo the authentication process. Upon calling the API, the online payment server returns the Bearer Token, which is the necessary authentication parameter for calling all further methods.

Header parameters
Content-Type
required
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization
required
Basic <base64>
'Basic ' + '<client_id>:<secret_key>' encoded in the Base64 format is transmitted as a value (e.g., 'Basic ODI4Mjo3Njk3MDY0OTlmMDcwOWUyMzQ4NDU4NjNmOThiMjMxNA=='), where <client_id> and <secret_key> are the credentials necessary to enter the system, transmitted by the bank to the business.

Body parameters
grant_type
required
client_credentials
The fixed text client_credentials is transmitted as the value.

CURL
curl -X POST 'https://oauth2.bog.ge/auth/realms/bog/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
-u {client_id}:{client_secret} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'

Response
access_token
string
The Token is returned by the authorization server.

token_type
string
The type of Token (fixed value – Bearer – is returned).

expires_in
number
The number of seconds while the Token is active.

RESPONSE
{

}

Order Request
To place an order request, businesses must send payment details, technical specifications, and the amount to be paid to the online payment server. If the process is successful, the customer should be redirected to the online payment page at the redirect address returned to the _link parameter to complete the payment.

Header parameters

optional
UUID v4
The Idempotency-Key parameter should be unique for each new API request. Subsequent requests to the same API endpoint with the same Idempotency-Key header will result in the server returning the same status code and response body as the initial request. This functionality is particularly useful to ensure consistent outcome in scenarios where network issues or retries may lead to duplicate requests.

Callback
Unlike other methods, which are initiated by the business, the callback method is triggered by the payment system. The logic for receiving and processing this callback must be implemented on the business side. This method allows the business to receive real-time updates on the payment status when:

The payment is completed successfully.
The payment is completed unsuccessfully.
The amount is fully or partially returned to the customer.
Payment details are sent to the callback URL, provided when the order was requested, using the POST method. To confirm successful receipt of the callback, the business should return HTTP CODE 200. If callback was not received successfully, business must use the Get Payment Details method to verify the payment status and correctly update the order status in its system.

note
Callback and Redirect URL serve distinct purposes:

Redirect URL - Redirects the customer from the online payment page back to the business’s website after payment, enhancing the user experience. However, it does not guarantee the final payment status, as redirection may fail due to user actions or other circumstances, making it essential to verify payment completion through a server-to-server callback.

Callbacks - Ensure payment status confirmation and the secure delivery of payment information from the online payment system’s server to the business’s server. Unlike Redirect URLs, callbacks are independent of user actions and serve as a reliable source for verifying payment status.
Header
Callback-Signature
optional
string
Signature generated by encrypting callback's request body with a private key using SHA256withRSA algorithm. In order to ensure integrity of callback data, business should verify signature using request body and public key. It is essential to execute this verification before the deserialization of the request body, ensuring that the order of fields remains unchanged.
